    xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item.Cable should be implemented on objects
    that represent a cable instance or a system cable instance.
properties:
    - name: Length
      type: double
      default: NaN
      description: >
          The length of the cable in meters.  The default value of NaN
          represents a cable of unknown length.
    - name: CableTypeDescription
      type: string
      default: ""
      description: >
          A free form, implementation defined string used to provide the type of
          a cable, such as optical or copper.  The cable type can be shown in
          user interfaces but this field should not be used for programmatic
          interrogation of a cable beyond ignoring the default value of the
          empty string.

    - name: CableStatus
      type: enum[self.Status]
      default: "Unknown"
      description: >
          The status of the cable. The default status is unknown.
enumerations:
    - name: Status

          Possible cable status
      values:
          - name: "Inactive"
            description: >
                Cable is inactive.
          - name: "Running"
            description: >
                Cable is running.
          - name: "PoweredOff"
            description: >
                Cable is powered off.
          - name: "Unknown"
            description: >
                Cable status is unknown.

          Objects that implement Cable can optionally implement the
          downstream_chassis association to provide a link to the chassis.
